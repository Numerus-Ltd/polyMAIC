# polyMAIC

## Overview
Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) is a technique used to account for the differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups in indirect comparisons, especially when individual patient data are available for one treatment, but only aggregate-level data exist for the comparator. The PolyMAIC method, proposed by Alsop and Pont<sup>1</sup>, uses fourth order polynomial functions to estimate individual patient weights (IPW). 

## Features 
This package:
1. Contains the simulated data used in  Alsop and Pont<sup>1</sup>.
1. Estimates IPWs.
2. Provides matching algorithm diagnostics.
3. Produces a histogram of re-scaled IPWs.
